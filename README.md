# about

This repo contains information about the github organizations **awesome-gocui**  

## Why  
Because the [original gocui repo](https://github.com/jroimartin/gocui) is unmaintained.  
And because most forks that currently exsists only have fixes only for a spesific usecase.  
New users will see gocui as a dead project while it's an amazing project with awsome usecases.  

That's why we created [awesome-gocui](https://github.com/awesome-gocui), we want to make gocui a active git project again where we accept PRs and hopefully make some helper libraries.

## Logos
Sadly we don't have a logo yet, If you want to help us with that feel free to make an issue
