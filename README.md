# about

This repo contains information about the github organizations **awesome-gocui**  

## Why  
Because the [original gocui repo](https://github.com/jroimartin/gocui) is unmaintained.  
And because most forks that currently exsists only have fixes only for a spesific usecase.  
New users will see gocui as a dead project while it's an amazing project with awsome usecases.  

That's why we created [awesome-gocui](https://github.com/awesome-gocui), we want to make gocui an active git project again where we accept PRs and hopefully make some helper libraries.

## Logos
Sadly we don't have a logo yet, If you want to help us with that feel free to make an issue

## Rules we try to follow
These are a list of rules we (members) try to follow when working on projects from awesome-gocui.  
All rules are spesific to one or more repos.

- New PRs must be seen by at least 2/3 from the all members
- PRs created by members must have an issue containng the underlaying Bug / Feature
